===============

This project contains the code behind <http://www.walterblaurock.com/>. I hope for it to someday become a hub for my online life, automatically pulling in content I've already posted elsewhere on the web; for now, it simply links you to that content.

Why Open Source?
----------------

This website is starting out as simple html and css, both of which are already visible to your browser. However, as I continue to develop this site, I hope to import and aggregate data from my various online profiles, and I would love to share this with the online community.
